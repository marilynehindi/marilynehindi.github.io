  <p class="besides">

  Besides exploring the beauty of Italy, my desire is to discover the world. I want to expand my album of photos and challenge my thinking in a different way to create dynamic designs. I think true creativity is reached when you push yourself out of your comfort zone and into new experiences. I want to use my eye for UI design combined with my knowledge of UX to push the expectations of the user and develop an unexpected experience.

  <p class="interest">

  My interests extend from painting to photography and I am able to implement them in my digital designs to give my work depth and creativity. I love new challenges, so tell me what you need and lets get started.
