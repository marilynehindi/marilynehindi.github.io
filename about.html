  <h2 class="about"> Hello, I'm Marilyne Hindi, Lebanese French, born and raised in Lebanon. 
  
  I did my bachelor degree in Graphics and Multimedia design  at Acad√©mie Libanaise Des Beaux-Arts, Beirut, Lebanon, and graduated in 2016.
  Now I'm living in Milano, currently working towards gaining my masters in Web And Digital Design from Scuola Politecnica Di Design, SPD.
  
  Besides exploring the beauty of Italy, my desire is to discover the world. I want to expand my album of photos and challenge my thinking in a different way to create dynamic designs. I think true creativity is reached when you push yourself out of your comfort zone and into new experiences. I want to use my eye for UI design to push the expectations of the user and develop an unexpected experience.
  
  My interests extend from painting to photography and I am able to implement them in my digital designs to give my work depth and creativity. I love new challenges, so tell me what you need and lets get started.
